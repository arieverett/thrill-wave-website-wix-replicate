# Wix → GitHub migration notes (updated Sept 27, 2026)

## How the content was captured

Wix doesn't export site code, so the live site was crawled page by page and rebuilt. Text is copied word for word (a few typos fixed, listed below). The layout follows the Wix design: League Spartan for the Futura-style headings, Montserrat for everything else, black pill navigation and arrow-box buttons, a white footer. Every page shares one content width (880px on desktop).

Where the new site goes beyond Wix, it's additive: entrance and scroll animations, video titles laid over every thumbnail (bold client, then the video name), a video lightbox, hover states, a category bar on the portfolio, one card style for every numbered tile (with arrows through the SITREP proof steps), a reading-progress bar on posts and smooth page-to-page transitions. All motion switches off for visitors who set "reduce motion" on their device.

## Page map

| Wix URL | New site |
|---|---|
| `/` | `src/pages/index.html` |
| `/portfolio` (6 categories, 36 videos) | `src/pages/portfolio.html` + `content/portfolio.json` |
| `/sitrep` | `src/pages/sitrep.html` |
| `/contact` | `src/pages/contact.html` |
| `/medical`, `/marketingchallenges`, `/app-landing-page` ("Process") | Rebuilt at launch, then taken off the site Sept 29, 2026 (not in the menu). 301 → `/portfolio#healthcare-medical`, `/contact`, `/sitrep`. Archived offline, not in this repo |
| `/blog` + posts at `/post/<slug>` | `content/posts/*.md` (58 posts; `premium-video-services-for-local-businesses-in-phoenix` removed Sept 29, 2026, 301 → `/blog`) |
| `/blog/categories/<cat>` | generated for the 8 categories that have posts |
| `/blog-feed.xml` | generated RSS feed at the same address |
| `/faq` (empty) | 301 → `/contact` |
| `/paywall`, `/inquiry-services-page` (Wix filler) | 301 → `/`, `/contact` |
| `/pricing-plans/*`, `/plans-pricing` (Wix "Plans & Pricing") | 301 → `/contact` |
| 5 empty blog categories (tech, sports, art, news, law) | 301 → `/blog` |

## Resolved

- **Reel:** "Watch our reel" and the "What we do" video play the Vimeo brand reel "Thrill Wave - Style is Eternal" (`1170100005`, set as `reel` in `content/site.json`).
- **Domain:** the canonical address moves from `www.thrillwave.com` (Wix) to `thrillwave.com`. A Cloudflare redirect rule sends every `www` URL to the same path without `www` (301), so old links, bookmarks and rankings follow. See README > Deploy.
- **Images:** all 112 downloaded from Wix, renamed descriptively, organized by page and compressed to WebP. Nothing loads from `static.wixstatic.com` any more.
- **Client logos:** all 13 identified and named (alt text): Relentless Beats, NFL, State Farm, NBC, UFC, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Golf Digest, Boston Scientific, Uber, UBS, 1st Bank, Aura, Pathnostics.
- **Calendly:** the booking widget uses the "30 Minute Video Consult" event (`christhrillwave/30-minute-meeting-clone`) and shows two columns with no inner scrolling.
- **Aurelio PT – Mission Statement:** the Vimeo ID captured from Wix (`2128718462`) no longer exists. It now uses YouTube `ASbLkvgd874`, the video whose thumbnail matches the Wix tile.
- **"Goilf Digest"** typo on Wix corrected to "Golf Digest". "Find a solution for that works" and "theres" typos fixed on /medical and /marketingchallenges.
- **`{Company Name}`** placeholder in `premium-video-services-for-local-businesses-in-phoenix` (five times on Wix) replaced with "Thrill Wave". (Post removed Sept 29, 2026.)

## Still open (need something from the team)

1. ~~**ITCA video on /sitrep.**~~ Closed Oct 1, 2026: "ITCA WIC - Dear Mom" is the right film for that spot (the WIC PSA the results paragraph describes), so it stays. `itcaVimeoId` remains available if a Vimeo version is ever preferred.
2. ~~**Stand-in header photos**~~ Done Sept 29, 2026: the /contact banner uses the original photo, and Home and SITREP play the Vimeo header video "Thrill Wave - Site Lander" (`1231402333`, set as `headerVideo` in `content/site.json`).
3. ~~**Contact page mailbox.**~~ Closed Oct 1, 2026: the mailbox sentence is no longer on /contact.
4. **SITREP animation.** Wix shows an animated particle graphic above the three steps (a custom embed). A static three-step panel stands in; send the embed code to recreate it.
5. ~~**Medical page videos** and **Marketing Challenges "Listen to our clients"**~~ No longer needed: both pages were taken off the site Sept 29, 2026.
6. ~~**Two posts end mid-sentence on Wix too:**~~ Closed Oct 1, 2026: the AI ad-campaign post was removed with the other AI posts, and the Arizona cinema history post was removed (factual errors and copyrighted movie posters); both URLs 301 to /blog.
7. ~~**Wix stock photos** on /marketingchallenges~~ Replaced Sept 28, 2026 with Thrill Wave shoot stills (doctor-explaining-scan-wide, clinicians-reviewing-tablet).
8. **`FORM_WEBHOOK_URL`** needs a destination before launch (see README > Deploy). The /contact page has the lead form again since Sept 29, 2026 (fields: source, first_name, last_name, email, phone, organization, message). Send a test lead after any change to the form or webhook.
9. ~~**Aurelio PT titles.**~~ Closed Oct 1, 2026: `ASbLkvgd874` is Aurelio's "Fitness Forward Performance" ad (Healthcare and Sports). `Ny-eNXzNrtA` is actually a Thrill Wave healthcare and medical supercut (per its YouTube description), now titled that way; its YouTube title still says Aurelio and should be renamed on YouTube.

## Wix-only features that didn't come over

- Blog likes, views and comments, member profiles (`/profile/*` now redirects to the blog) and the paywall.
- Wix Forms submission history and Wix Analytics history. Export them from the Wix dashboard before cancelling.

## Next up (noted Sept 29, 2026)

- **Next session (noted Oct 1, 2026):**
  - **Terminal site live at terminal.thrillwave.com** (repo arieverett/thrillwave-website-terminal): its own Cloudflare Pages project and subdomain.
  - ~~**Red pill / blue pill homepage hero**~~ Done Oct 2, 2026: glossy red "Take the red pill" (glows) and blue "Keep scrolling" pills (jumps to Hi, welcome), with a dotted line and moving glow under the blue pill. The red pill links to https://terminal.thrillwave.com/ (live Oct 2, 2026 on its own Cloudflare Pages project; the terminal site is noindexed so it stays an easter egg). Both pills and the neon line now wait for the headline to finish typing, then fade in and a hit of light sweeps left to right across each outline and label, like light crossing reflective tape (white-hot core, halo in the button's colour; blue, then red, then the line draws down). Code: "pills-wait" / "pills-in" in site.js and site.css.
  - ~~**Individual pages**~~ Done Oct 1, 2026: 12 industry pages (`/industries/<name>`), 5 customer type pages (`/who-we-serve/<name>`; Nonprofits shares the Nonprofits industry page so there's one page per topic) and 5 case study pages (`/case-studies/<title>`), all generated from `content/home.json`. Every industry had at least one real film, so all 12 got pages. Linked from the homepage tiles and cards, the Industries, Our customers and Case studies pages, SITREP, each other, the sitemap and llms.txt.
  - ~~**Customer and industry restructure**~~ Done Oct 3, 2026: five customer types (Film, Media, Agencies & PR firms, Nonprofits & government, Businesses; Brands and Companies merged into Businesses, Nonprofits got its own page) and 11 industries (Medical, Wellness, Sports, Live Events, Hospitality, Professional Services, Tech, Industrial, Products, Tribal Nations, Government & Public Affairs; Real Estate and the Nonprofits industry removed). Old URLs 301 in `public/_redirects`.
  - **Case study gaps (need the team):** production days, shoot locations and crew size for each case (`facts`), a client quote with name and title (`quote`), and real results from the clients themselves (views, reach, enrollments, leads). The stat boxes today are public numbers around each client, not results we measured. Each shows up on its page as soon as it's added to `content/home.json`.
  - **Final pass for anything missed** before wrapping up the main site, then resubmit the sitemap in Google Search Console.

- ~~About us page~~ Done Sept 29, 2026 (`/about`, copy adapted from the terminal site). Contact form added to `/contact` the same day.
- **Case studies:** start with ITCA (TEC, WIC, Your Voice Your Power): problem, SITREP finding, film, result.
- **Your Voice, Your Power (Oct 8, 2026):** the 10-part ITCA Native Vote docuseries is released (all episodes on aznativevote.org/docuseries and the YouTube playlist). It now has its own case study (`/case-studies/your-voice-your-power`) with an episode guide (`episodes` and `series` in its `cases` entry, rendered in `lib/breakout.mjs` with TVSeries structured data), leads the case studies, sits second in the homepage film carousel (the trailer replaced High Vibe Kitchen) and leads Tribal Nations on Work. Facts from the partners: 9 months of production, made ahead of the 2026 midterms, screened at the NatiVisions Film Festival (BlueWater Cinemas, Parker, Sept 23 to 26, 2026) and the Heard Museum's First Friday (Phoenix, Oct 2, 2026). Ari dropped the "1 year start to finish" and "crew on set" facts on Oct 8, 2026 as too weak. **Not going to PBS** (ITCA is still trying), so never say it's headed to or airing on PBS unless the partners confirm it. Thrill Wave plans to submit it for a short film ADDY and the 50th Emmys in 2027; keep award mentions off the site until there's a nomination or win. Upload dates for the trailer and the Legislature episode were added Oct 8, 2026. Still to add: the other episodes' dates in `content/video-meta.json`, a quote from ITCA, set stills.
- **Welcome to WIC (Oct 8, 2026):** the ITCA WIC case study was renamed from Dear Mom to Welcome to WIC (`/case-studies/welcome-to-wic`, 301 from `/case-studies/dear-mom`), named after the series of 19 short WIC films Thrill Wave made for ITCA (all uploaded to ITCA's YouTube on Dec 2, 2025). Dear Mom stays the featured film and the stats are unchanged; all 19 series films sit in More from the project. Six case studies for now; one will be archived later.
- ~~**Blog cleanup**~~ Done Oct 3, 2026: 27 posts that pitched a marketing agency, ads, social media management or repeated another post were removed (301 → /blog). The 24 kept posts were rewritten in the current voice (no agency or AI talk, no dated stats, each ends with a line to /contact), re-dated across Jan to Sep 2026 and regrouped into four categories: Craft, Industries, Arizona, Planning a Video (old category URLs 301). New posts: weekly (Tuesdays) from a scheduled task since Oct 5, 2026, alternating craft posts with field and customer posts.
- **Google Business Profile:** new tagline, services, photos, a push for 10+ reviews.
- **Pages the homepage buttons are waiting for (noted Sept 30, 2026; build only when Ari asks):** `/services` ("See our services" in What we do), `/who-we-serve` ("See who we serve") and `/process` ("See our process"). The buttons are already in `src/pages/index.html` with `data-until-built`, so they point back to their own homepage section until the page file exists, then link to it on their own.
- **Homepage rethink (started Sept 30, 2026):** final section order and copy, fewer sections, a conversational voice that reads like a 30-second pitch (references: sandwich.co and the Thrill Wave terminal site; lookstudios.co as the "too much" example). Ari will send full-page screenshots of reference sites.
- **Housekeeping:** resubmit the sitemap in Google Search Console once the new pages (Services, Who we serve, Process, Case studies) are live (first submitted after launch; Ari asked to be reminded); make the GitHub repo private; DMARC to p=quarantine a few weeks after launch; compare Search Console and Cloudflare numbers to the Wix baseline (~84 visits/month) around the end of October.
- ~~**Code cleanup with speed, SEO and AEO in mind**~~ Done Oct 1, 2026: removed ~70 unused style rules left from the Wix-era pages, merged repeated video-player code, added the services to the structured data, descriptive alt text on team photos and case-study stills, and made the homepage sections reusable (`src/templates/page-starter.html`, body classes `page-sections` and `page-typed`, see CLAUDE.md > Building a new page).
- **Content engine:** automatically draft and publish new Intel articles every week or month for SEO and answer engines (AEO).
- **Rebuild on Astro** plus a broader design and backend overhaul (see README > Moving to Astro later).
- ~~**Code cleanup, round 2**~~ Done Oct 3, 2026: build.mjs split into `lib/` modules (output byte-for-byte identical), a few dead style rules removed (a scan found the stylesheet otherwise fully used), RSS feed images fixed for remote covers.
